        <p>Just like everything - automation testing has its pros and cons. Here we will look at the
            pros and cons of the automation process.</p>

        <p>In addition there are couple of things to take care when you automate such as </p>
        <ol id="ol_rrq_yyq_xpb">
            <li>Not all test cases need to be automated</li>
            <li>Time needed for automation testing is comparable to the time spent on software
                development</li>
            <li>Before writing automated tests you need to work on test system architecture.
                Otherwise apart from manual testing you will need to support automated tests</li>
            <li>When implementing automation, it is impossible to foresee all the risks and
                challenges you might face in the future</li>
